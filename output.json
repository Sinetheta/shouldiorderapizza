    "text": "I tried to order Ali Baba with some friends however I was extremely disappointed by their customer service. I called at 11:15pm, knowing they deliver until 12 am and the 'gentlemen' who answered the phone was extremely rude with me. He asked for my phone number and when I asked if I could call him back to double check it he said fine, but when I called back and tried to give him my contact he interrupted me and asked me where I lived and when I tried to tell him where I lived he said \"sorry I can't hear you all I hear is mumble , mumble...\" and I could hear him talking and laughing with somebody in the background. He then cut me off when I was relaying the address and he said that he would not deliver to my address. I'm not sure if they were not interested in delivering to my address because of the time, or maybe the distance is too far... but they really need to improve on their customer service skills and if they post that they are open until 12 am, they should at least be professional until closing. I live a 10 minute walk from the University so I don't see why they wouldn't deliver to my address. Any way, I will never order from here because of their offensive mockery.",
